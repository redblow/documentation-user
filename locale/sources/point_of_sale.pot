So we provide a ramdisk for /etc and /var (Raspbian automatically provides one for /tmp). These ramdisks are setup by ``setup_ramdisks.sh``, which we run before all other init scripts by running it in ``/etc/init.d/rcS``. The ramdisks are named /etc_ram and /var_ram respectively. Most data from /etc and /var is copied to these tmpfs ramdisks. In order to restrict the size of the ramdisks, we do not copy over certain things to them (eg. apt related data). We then bind mount them over the original directories. So when an application writes to /etc/foo/bar it's actually writing to /etc_ram/foo/bar.
